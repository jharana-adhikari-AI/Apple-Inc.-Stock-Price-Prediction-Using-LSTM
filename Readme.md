## Apple Inc. Stock Price Prediction Using LSTM
#### Description
This project focuses on predicting Apple Inc.'s stock prices using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that is well-suited for time series forecasting tasks. The model is trained on historical stock price data and used to predict future stock prices, enabling insights into Apple's stock price trends. The analysis also includes data preprocessing, normalization, and evaluation of model performance using various metrics.

#### Key Takeaways
- üìâ Stock Price Trends ‚Äì Apple's stock has shown significant growth over the years, with some volatile periods reflecting market corrections or economic events.
- üìâ Prediction vs. Actual Prices ‚Äì The LSTM model performs well in predicting Apple stock prices, showing a close alignment with actual stock prices in recent years.
- üèÜ Model Accuracy ‚Äì The LSTM model provides a strong fit to the data with a high R¬≤ score of 0.9575, indicating that it explains 95.75% of the variance in the stock prices.
- üî¥ Error Metrics ‚Äì The model's Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) are relatively low, demonstrating its predictive reliability.
- üìä Predictive Insights ‚Äì The model captures both long-term trends and short-term fluctuations, though minor improvements could enhance predictions during extreme market changes.

##### Model Performance Metrics
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 4.5925
- Mean Squared Error (MSE): 179.9613
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 13.4150
- R¬≤ Score: 0.9575


#### Conclusion
The LSTM model demonstrates strong predictive accuracy in forecasting Apple Inc.'s stock prices:

The low MAE and RMSE indicate that the model‚Äôs predictions are close to the actual values, with minimal error.
A high R¬≤ score suggests the model explains 95.75% of the variance in the stock prices, proving its effectiveness.
While the model performs well overall, further tuning could help it handle extreme fluctuations, such as those caused by market corrections or stock splits, even more accurately.


#### Future Improvements
Incorporating more features such as news sentiment analysis or macroeconomic factors could improve prediction accuracy.
Tuning the LSTM model with additional layers, neurons, or optimization techniques could further enhance performance, especially during volatile market periods.
